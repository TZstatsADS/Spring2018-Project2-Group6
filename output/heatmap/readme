this heatmap file include three heatmap matrix which grasp a grid map of manhattan.

each datamatrix has 1850*1500 cells, latitude through 40.6 to 40.9 and longtitude through -74.05 to -73.41.
each cell is 0.0001*0.0001 square degrees.

When using the data to make further influence, You can use a convert function to change the real location to matrix form 
by 
convert=function(rx=realongitude,ry=realatitude,)
{
  step=0.0001
  originpoint=c(-74.05,40.6)
  i=(rx-originpoint[1])/step
  j=(ry-originpoint[2])/step
 return(c(i,j))
 }
