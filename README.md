+ **Project summary**: 

People have described Apartment Hunting as a fate worse than Death. Do you remember your days when you were back in your home-country anxiously looking for an apartment that is affordable and safe? Inspired by every student's problem, we made an application that will help a renter find a room based on top two priorities- price and safety. Our application will provide a comprehensive view of the rent prices and crime rate in every street in the Manhattan Borough of New York City. 

The application is divided into three sections- a query map where the user can feed in their choices, and get all the apartment options categorized by crime rate and apartment price in their desired area. In the second section, we have tried to make a linear model in order to predict the prices of apartments based on crime in the area. In the last section, we summarize our study by providing several insightful charts about the categories of crimes committed, and rent prices. 
We have used NYPD Complaint Data (to get crime related data), and Manhattan Housing Data from www.data.gov .
